# Dev Workflow with Agents

A workshop repo for slides and hands-on exercises that teach developers how to work with AI agents in a structured, repeatable way.

## Audience

Developers across web, mobile, and back-end stacks. Content is mostly stack-agnostic with practical examples.

Assumed knowledge: LLMs, agents, tools. We skip the basics and focus on practical application.

## Tools

- Cursor (primary demo tool)
- Claude Code
- Slidev (presentation)
- RSPress (cookbook/documentation)

## Workshop Structure

1. **Presentation (30 min)** - Core principles and tooling orientation
2. **Hands-on session** - Each engineer works on their real tasks with guidance
3. **Cookbook** - RSPress documentation site as reference during hands-on

## Two Pillars

The core principles of working with agents break into two parts:

### Pillar 1: Prepare Your Repo

Make your codebase a place where agents can thrive. Structure, configuration, and context boundaries.

### Pillar 2: Work With Your Agent

The actual workflow when executing tasks. Planning, prompting, reviewing, iterating.
