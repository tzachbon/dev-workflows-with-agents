# Pillar 2: Work With Your Agent

The actual workflow when executing tasks.

---

## Core Concept: Spec-Driven Development

Work with AI is iterative by design. You don't write once and ship - you **plan, execute, review, iterate**.

This is spec-driven development:
1. Define what you want (the spec)
2. Let the agent implement
3. Review the output
4. Refine and repeat

**Why Pillar 1 matters here:** A well-prepared repo makes each iteration faster. The agent finds context immediately, reducing time spent on each cycle.

## Workflow

1. **Bring a real task** - Each participant opens a ticket or feature they need to complete
2. **Plan with the agent** - Use planning mode in Cursor to break down the work
3. **Choose the right model** - Match model capabilities to task complexity
4. **Divide the work** - Split into small, reviewable chunks
5. **Review and iterate** - Check AI output, refine context, repeat

## Key Insight

The hands-on approach is critical. Reading about AI workflows doesn't break the barrier. Sitting down with a real task and working through it does.

## Treat AI Output Like a Junior Dev PR

Don't treat agent output as gospel:
- Review every change
- Question assumptions
- Verify against tests
- Refine prompts based on output

## Notes

(Add your guidelines here as we iterate)
