# Pillar 2: Work With Your Agent

The actual workflow when executing tasks.

---

## Workflow

1. **Bring a real task** - Each participant opens a ticket or feature they need to complete
2. **Plan with the agent** - Use planning mode in Cursor to break down the work
3. **Choose the right model** - Match model capabilities to task complexity
4. **Divide the work** - Split into small, reviewable chunks
5. **Review and iterate** - Check AI output, refine context, repeat

## Key Insight

The hands-on approach is critical. Reading about AI workflows doesn't break the barrier. Sitting down with a real task and working through it does.
